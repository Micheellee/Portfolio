            <h3>WordPress</h3>
            <p>
              I have been working with WordPress for over a year and it is a
              great open-source content management system. With your own theme
              WordPress is very flexible and perfect for clients, as they can
              change the content of their site without needing to write a single
              line of code.
            </p>

          <div>
            <i class="fas fa-shopping-cart fa-2x"></i>
            <h3>WooCommerce</h3>
            <p>
              WooCommerce is an open-source e-commerce plugin for WordPress. It
              is designed for small to large-sized online merchants using
              WordPress. I have been using WooCommerce in the last months for
              clients as it is more and more important to sell products directly
              from their site. This has helped our clients to establish a
              dominant online presence.

            <h3>UI/UX</h3>
            <p>
              I started with UI/UX design before coming across web development
              and since then I continuously work on improving my Web Design and
              UI/UX skills as it is important to keep the end-user behavior and
              experience in mind.

            <h3>ADOBE CREATIVE SUITE</h3>
            <p>
              Adobe Creative Suite offers a great variety of tools for designers
              and developers. I have been using Photoshop to edit images,
              InDesign for email marketing and XD to create skeletal frameworks
              of websites. Adobe Creative Suite offers a great variety of tools
              for designers and developers.

            <h3>Information Gathering</h3>
            <p>
              This first step is actually the most important one, as it involves
              a solid understanding of the company it is created for. It is
              important to start off by asking a lot of questions to help
              understand the business and needs in a web site.
            </p>

            </i>
            <h3>Planning</h3>
            <p>
              Using the information gathered a site map and wireframe is
              developed. The Site map serves as a guide as to what content will
              be on the site and the wireframe gives an outline of the structure
              and layout of the page.

            </i>
            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>
              The design gives the change to express likes and dislikes of the
              site before development. One or more prototype can be designed for
              the web site until a mutual agreement is reached. Once the final
              design is approved the development can begin.
            </p>

          <div>
            <i class="far fa-code fa-4x process-icon my-2">
              <div class="process-step">4</div>
            </i>
            <h3>Development</h3>
            <p>
              We create the actual functional site by developing the home page,
              followed by the "shell" for the interior pages. As it is important
              to stay consistent throughout the site the shell will give the
              site some structure. Then the content will be distributed
              throughout the site.
              <br />
              Elements such as the CMS (content management system) like
              WordPress, interactive contact forms, or eCommerce shopping carts
              are implemented and made functional during this phase, as well.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <i class="fal fa-analytics fa-4x process-icon my-2">
              <div class="process-step">5</div>
            </i>
            <h3>Testing and Delivery</h3>
            <p>
              As part of testing the complete functionality of forms or other
              scripts will be checked, as well last testing for compatibility
              issues, ensuring that the site is optimized to be viewed properly
              in the most recent browser versions
              <br />
              After the final approval, it is time to deliver the site. An FTP
              (File Transfer Protocol) program is used to upload the web site
              files to a server, a domain name registered and web hosting set
              up.

              <div class="process-step">6</div>
            </i>
            <h3>Maintenance</h3>
            <p>
              The development of the web site is not necessarily over. Content
              needs to updated on a regular basis, analytics of user behavior
              needs to be analyzed to find changes that need to be made to
              improve the end-user experience. Other maintenance type items
              include regular site backups, WordPress upgrades, additional
              plugin installation, etc.
