              After I completed my apprenticeship in Hotel Management, I
              traveled to Australia in October 2015. I fell in love with
              Melbourne and it's cultural diversity and decided to stay for
              good. I received my Permanent Residency in March 2020 and live
              since in the western suburbs with my partner and our Mini Lop
              rabbit, Harry Hopper.

              I worked in hospitality for seven years when I came across UX
              design and coding and have been very passionate about it ever
              since. I started working towards a career as a Web Developer by
              taking online classes and teaching myself the fundamentals. After
              a few months, I successfully got a job with Parable Productions.

                  At Parable Productions, I got more practical experience in
                  developing, enhancing, and maintaining websites for in house
                  projects and clients. I work closely with clients and aim to
                  fulfill their expectations and create a great user experience
                  for their audience. It is a small company but this has given
                  me the opportunity to not only learn to code but also gain
                  independent problem-solving intuitions and all-rounder
                  knowledge.
